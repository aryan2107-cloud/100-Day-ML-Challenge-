# 🚀 100 Days of Machine Learning

A hands-on journey from data foundations to production-ready ML systems.

---

## 📋 About

This repository documents my 100-day challenge to master machine learning through daily projects. Each day produces working code, not just theory.

**Start Date:** January 2025  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch  
**Environment:** Google Colab

---

## 🗺️ The Plan

| Phase | Days | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| **1. Data Foundations** | 1-15 | Data quality, preprocessing, EDA |
| **2. Classical ML** | 16-40 | Regression, classification, clustering |
| **3. Deep Learning** | 41-65 | Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs |
| **4. Specialized Topics** | 66-85 | NLP, time series, recommenders |
| **5. Production & Projects** | 86-100 | Deployment, end-to-end projects |

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-of-ml.git
   ```

2. Open any notebook in Google Colab:
   - Navigate to the day's folder
   - Open the `.ipynb` file
   - Click "Open in Colab" or upload manually

3. Each day is self-contained with its own:
   - Colab notebook
   - README explaining concepts
   - Saved outputs (where applicable)

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a reusable ML toolkit
- Understand *why* techniques work, not just *how*
- Create portfolio-worthy projects
- Document the learning journey
